# Labyrinth
Instructions

Before running the program please download the 3 maze files (labyrinthE, labyrinthM, labyrinthH) and the leaderboard file and have them in the same folder as the program. 

Don't be fooled that the medium maze is smaller than the easy one!

If you ever want to reset the leaderboard, delete everything in the file and put a 0.

Enjoy!
